# Investor's Movie Recommendation System

## Description 

We analyse the revenue, director, rating and genre for each movie and make a detailed analysis as to which movies in the past have performed well and try to apply the same configuration for our machine learning model to ensure that the producer has the most profitable movie. We also accompany our analysis with visualizations that can help us better understand the data.

## Setup

This project is written completely in Python code, you can execute this project either on Ed CSE 163 workspace or other environments that can execute Python code such as Visual Studio Code or Jupiter Notebook. You can run the command 'python main.py' on the terminal to run the main file of our project. Our code also uses pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn libraries and installation and set up for these libraries must be ensured.
